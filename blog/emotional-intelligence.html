          <h3 class="content-sub-title">What is emotional intelligence?</h3>
          <p class="content-text">	Emotional intelligence (also referred to as emotional quotient (EQ) is about being aware of your own and other people's thoughts and emotions. Furthermore, it is about understanding those thoughts and emotions and using that understanding to guide your behaviour. 
          <br><br> Daniel Goleman asserts that there are five key elements that shape our emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Self-awareness essentially means that you can notice how you are thinking, acting and feeling with an objective lens.</li>
            <li>Self-regulation is the act of controlling impulses by thinking before acting. It might look like taking deep breaths when you feel angry to calm down, instead of yelling at someone straight away out of instinct.</li>
            <li>Motivation, in the context of emotional intelligence, is broadly about setting goals to work towards and implementing the commitment it takes to achieve them.</li>
            <li>Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person from their perspective.</li>
            <li>Social skills are the skills we use to interact with other people successfully. These include things such as introducing yourself to someone new, leading a constructive conversation, listening to someone who is sharing how they feel or confronting someone when they have upset us. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="content-text">Emotional intelligence can be increased and honed through a variety of practices.</p>
          <h3 class="content-sub-title">How is it different to IQ?</h3>
          <p class="content-text">Intelligence quotient (IQ) on the other hand, is a score from a type of standardised test to assess a person's intelligence. IQ usually relates to academic ability as a high score indicates strong ability in skills such as maths, writing, logical reasoning and analytical thinking whereas a low score may indicate that someone could face challenges in learning these skills.</p>
          <h3 class="content-sub-title">Why is emotional intelligence important?</h3>
          <p class="content-text">	In a professional environment, while our ability to pick up skills quickly and comprehensively is important, emotional intelligence has been shown to be just as, if not more, important. A good level of emotional intelligence is crucial to being an effective leader. There is no point having a team leader with a lot of technical knowledge, 
          but no understanding of how to listen to or have a productive meeting with, their direct reports. <br><br> Outside of work, emotional intelligence is crucial to contentment and fulfilment. It allows us to understand ourselves and what makes us happy and it allows us to have meaningful relationships with others. </p>
