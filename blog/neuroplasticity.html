        <p class="content-text">
        <b>What are the benefits of understanding neuroplasticity?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Neuroplasticity means that our brains are malleable and can be exercised to change and grow stronger.<br>There are so many benefits to understanding this but to name a few:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>People are encouraged to try and learn new skills, rather than assuming things such as "that's too hard" or "I'm too old". The more that they try and learn, the better their capacity becomes for learning other skills. Not only is it rewarding to learn a skill in itself, but this also has very positive flow-on effects for things such as self-esteem and a sense of purpose and fulfilment.</li>
          <li>People who suffer from brain damage can work on recovering function by engaging in repetitive challenges where the difficulty increments. Before neuroscientists realised that the brain could grow and change after a certain stage of life, it was believed that the effects of damage to the brain would be permanent.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class = "content-text">
        <b>How do I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        When I am feeling like I am in my panic-zone, I try to remind myself that this is a new skill I am learning and that I have only just started exercising my brain in it! I find it helpful to imagine my brain with areas labelled with the thing I am trying to learn - for example, JavaScript, and a pathway leading to it. Before I started engaging with the material, there was no pathway there. Once I engaged with the material at first, the pathway became a little bit more visible and this keeps happening each time I practise. Here's hoping one day the pathway will be something like a high-speed railway line!

        <b>How can you increase your neuroplasticity?</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Set yourself a challenge (i.e it should be tricky) that involves new skills - this might be something like learning a language, learning to knit, learning to dance, doing crossword puzzles (especially cryptic ones!) etc.</li>
          <li>Practise the skills that are challenging you - repetition is very important. Once you have a particular stage under control, add in something that will make it a little bit more difficult.</li>
          <li>Diet, exercise, sleep and social connection are also important.</li>
        </ul>

        I found this article by psychologist Megan Call, particularly the table on how to get started in increasing your neuroplasticity, really helpful:

        <b>What is it and why is it relevant?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        A mindset is a "set of beliefs that shape how you make sense of the world and yourself. It influences how you think, feel, and behave in any given situation" <a href = "https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-mindset-2795025">(VeryWell Mind).</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        Psychologist Carol Dweck has done extensive research on mindsets and how they impact our ability to achieve things. She proposes that there are two mindsets - fixed and growth. Put very simply,  someone with a fixed mindset is likely to believe that they either can do something, or they can't. Someone with a growth mindset believes that while they might not be able to do something right now, if they work on it they will be able to do it in the future.
        <br>
        <br>
        These mindsets affect so many things, including our perceptions, our motivation, our attitudes and our interactions with others. All of those things then impact our ability to achieve our goals.

        <b>In this exploration did anything surprise you? Change for you?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Hearing Joseph talk about 'not being a math person' in a video this week and then doing this exploration made me realise the connection between motivation, neuroplasticity and a growth mindset. I have never enjoyed math-based activities or challenges, ever since primary school. If I ever try them again, I generally give up after it being difficult for a while and say 'my brain just isn't wired that way'. As a general skill, I am just not that interested in maths and (until now) haven't needed to persevere beyond the basics to do the things I want to do. However, when I really wanted to learn to knit because I wanted to have beautiful handmade things, I persevered even though my co-ordination sucked, I had the pace of a sloth and my first few things were lopsided washcloths. I'm not an expert, but I'm now making things I am really proud of and I can see that improvement when I look back at older things I made. 
        </p>

        <b>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        I would like to work on accepting constructive criticism and using it to make what I produce better. I have a tendency to get quite down-hearted in the face of criticism and I don't want that to make me throw my hands up and give up. I would also like to focus on being inspired by the work of my peers, rather than viewing it was a level I will never be able to attain.
