          <h3 class="content-sub-title">Core personal values</h3>
          <p class="content-text">Some of my core personal values are <span class=ital>thoughtfulness</span>, <span class="ital">open-mindedness </span>and keeping <span class="ital">work and life balanced</span>.</p>
            <p class="content-text">I try to live my life by being thoughtful about how my actions will affect other people and the environment around me. For me, this looks like being kind, compassionate and not always doing things in the most convenient way by default!
            I hope that many of my actions have positive affects, and where I can think of ways to lessen the negative effects, I will try my best to put those into practice.</p>
            <p class="content-text">I think it is easy to assume that the way we have always done something or the way that we prefer to do something is the 'only way' or the 'best way'. I like to keep myself open to learning from others and implementing what I have learned where I think it has a positive impact.
            For me, this also looks like respecting differences in opinion when I don't agree and recognising that the same way of doing something does not work for everyone.</p>
            <p class="content-text">While I recognise the importance of work as a way to sustain myself and to contribute to my community, I strongly believe that it should not be the biggest factor in our lives. Obviously we all wish to live comfortably, but I see some people moving the bar of what comfortable looks 
            like higher and higher, until all they do is work without having any time to enjoy their 'comfortable' life. I think it is important to leave time for rest, for interests and for family and friends.</p>
            <p class="content-text">While not at all ground-breaking as an ethical decision, about a year and a half ago I decided to sell our household's second car, in favour of relying more heavily on an e-bike, the bus and walking. I now realise how much my core values affected that decision. My husband and I were
            both using a car almost every day out of convenience, but I started to be more thoughtful about how I was contributing to congestion and emissions. I opened my mind to different ways of getting around and gave them a go. I recognised that, most of the time, the other methods weren't as convenient but I cared 
            more about lessening my impact than convenience and committed to selling my car</p>
            <p class="content-text">I feel like going through my formative years during the rapid growth of social media has had a huge influence on my values, particularly in terms of open-mindedness. While it is certainly easy to be influenced into negative habits or behaviours, I have found that it has made me encounter 
            so many different viewpoints and I make conscious decisions to not automatically be dismissive of them. It has also made me acutely aware that I am privileged to have had the upbringing, experiences and opportunities that I have had.</p>
          <h3 class="content-sub-title">Strengths and areas for development</h3>
          <p class="content-text">In my last job, I learnt that one of my greatest strengths is my ability and willingness to <span class="ital"> share knowledge</span>. When we had to use new processes as a team, we weren't always given the clearest instructions. I found I was good at writing out process flows in a way that 
            others on my team could understand and always made the time to walk them through steps as they tried them if that was a better way for them to learn. However, I also knew when it was time to give them a push and encourage them to just give it a go without me.</p> 
          <p class="content-text">I am also <span class="ital">conscientious</span> (it has come up in almost every school report or performance review I've ever had). I like to be able to be proud of the work that I have done and proud of the way in which I did it. </p>
          <p class="content-text">I think my ability to share knowledge will be helpful on my learning journey, as it helps me be a team player. I also will need to make sure I am seeking knowledge from others because there will be so much I don't understand straight away. I will be conscientious in the work that I do, but I 
            will need to be careful that this doesn't turn into obsessing over small parts when it is time to move on.</p>
          <p class="content-text">In terms of areas for development, I am aware that my instinct is to <span class="ital">avoid confrontation</span>.  I think this comes from not wanting to upset anyone, and a <span class="ital">lack of confidence</span> and <span class="ital">assertiveness</span>. I would really like to improve my confidence for my future career development. 
            I think I have missed out on some opportunities in the past because I was too shy to share my thoughts, embarrassed to disagree or simply lacked confidence to try something new. Leaving my job and enrolling with Dev Academy is one of the biggest steps out of my comfort zone I have ever taken so I am feeling the 'professional whiplash' 
            (as my facilitator called it) already and trying to embrace it.</p>
          <p class="content-text">When thinking about working with others, one particular group project in my last year of university comes to mind. It was a class that was particularly important to me, and out of four of us, only myself and one other student seemed interested in doing the work. We met up regularly, planned, started writing and the 
            whole time we were trying to contact they other students to ask for their input but there were usually just vague promises to make it to the study session next time. In the end, myself and the other student basically doubled our workload to make sure that the result was good. I found it really stressful, and disappointed that we all got the same grade, despite the 
            contributions not being equal.<br><br> It was a good lesson to learn, because those situations will come up many times in life - not everyone will attribute the same importance to a piece of work. On reflection, I did definitely avoid confrontation. We asked them to contribute, but when they didn't, I could have asked more about why and could have explained the kind of pressure 
            they were putting me and the other student under. It may have made them think more about what it means to be a team player and might have encouraged involvement. I also think now I would have had a discussion right up front about how the work was going to be divided up to set expectations so that there was something to hold them accountable to. </p>
