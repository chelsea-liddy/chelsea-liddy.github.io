          <b>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I'm not always very kind to myself when I don't know how to do something and that can stop me moving forward.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes my mind wanders a bit when I am trying to fully listen to someone and other times I find it hard not to jump in with what I think the person is going to say next.
          </li>
          <li>
            I find it hard to ask for help sometimes because I worry that I will be so off the mark that it will be embarrassing. 
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class = "content-text">
          <b>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          <i>Values</i>
          <br>
          Your values can determine the way that you interact with other people, and programming involves a lot of working with other people!
          <br>
          Your values also shape the way you approach learning, and if you aren't aware of them you may not realise how to adapt your learning to get the outcome you want. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <i>Empathy</i>
          <br>
          It is important to understand that people are learning alongside you - and while you might be at a different stage to them, you need to understand what they are feeling like at the stage they are at. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <i>Self-awareness</i>
          <br>
          It is important to be aware of things such as your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning. This helps determine which learning style is going to work for you best. You also need to have self-awareness when working with other people on projects - if you are aware of how you can respond negatively in certain situations, you can take steps to avoid those situations or put into practise things that help you control your response.

          <b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          I think it has been realising just how much value tech employers place on the core skills. I've always known those things would be important to most employers, but I did assume that in the tech sector a higher importance would be placed on hiring someone with the skills to hit the ground running. It is heartening to hear that many of them would rather hire a person with the right attitude and core skills, and then invest in developing their tech skills further. 
        </p>

        <p class = "content-text">
          <b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          I think it was writing these blog posts and flexing the muscle for digesting a whole lot of information and then sharing it in your own words and with your own insights. 
        </p>

        <p class = "content-text">
          <b>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          It's pretty clear to me now that it is because that is the feedback the school is hearing from employers. I've heard plenty of anecdotes now about employers choosing individuals who are well-rounded in both interpersonal skills and tech skills, over people who have years of tech experience. Employers know that a healthy workplace culture is built on valuing all the different facets that each employee brings to the table. 
        </p>

        <p class = "content-text">
          <b>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          Not at all. I feel more prepared about the kinds of skills employers will be expecting to see demonstrated and I learnt things about myself, which is highly valuable.
