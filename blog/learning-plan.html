        <h2 class="content-title">Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
        <h3 class = "content-sub-title">Long term goal</h3>
        <p class = "content-text">
          Once I leave Bootcamp, I would like to be well on my way to being employed as a front-end web developer and designer. I don't have a destination in mind, but ideally I would like to be working with small businesses to help them have an impressive online presence. 
        </p>
        <h3 class = "content-sub-title">Strengths and limitations</h3>
        <p class = "content-text">
          Foundations has reinforced that I have quite a lot of perseverance. There were occasions where I could have just given up, or got something working without knowing how, but I kept pushing through until I properly understood what was happening. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I am very receptive to the idea of the human skills curriculum, which I think will be important to making it through Bootcamp.
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm a bit worried about energy levels, particularly the concept of pushing on at night after having already done a solid day. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I also think a lack of self-confidence and comparing myself to others could hold me back a bit. 
        </p>

        <h3 class = "content-sub-title">Non-technical challenges</h3>
        <p class = "content-text">
          I think it will be confidence speaking in front of others and not being embarrassed to get things wrong. I feel like it will be easy to get frightened by other people being 'ahead'. 
        </p>

        <h3 class = "content-sub-title">Human skills to develop</h3>
        <p class = "content-text">
          I want to make sure I take criticism as a learning opportunity, rather than just feeling disheartened. I also find confrontation difficult, so I am looking forward to the sessions on receiving feedback and having difficult conversations. 
        </p>

        <h3 class = "content-sub-title">Expectations of the Bootcamp team</h3>
        <p class = "content-text">
          For this course, support to me looks like receiving regular and honest feedback about how I am going, as I would like to have a realistic picture of what I'm ready for once I have finished the course.
          <br>
          <br>
          I also expect a safe space to express how I am feeling (from what I hear, this is built into the kaupapa of Human Skills, so I'm not worried!)
          <br>
          <br>
          I expect to be guided towards answers, rather than flat out being told the answer so that I have to fully understand what is happening to reach the solution. 
        </p>

        <h3 class = "content-sub-title">Expectations of myself</h3>
        <p class = "content-text">
          I will make sure I have thought about what I want to raise at my Tech-ins and my Human Skills check ins and not let those opportunities be wasted.
          <br>
          <br>
          I will let my family know how they can support me and I will not commit to things that will pull large amounts of time and focus away from Bootcamp. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I will treat myself, my peers, Facilitators and any industry or community representatives with kindness and respect at all times to play my part in making the programme an uplifting and supportive environment to be in.

      <!--SECTION 2-->
      <div class="section2">
        <a id="foundations-plan"><h2 class="content-title">Foundations Learning Plan</h2></a>
          <h3 class="content-sub-title">My long term goal</h3>
          <p class="content-text">My goal is to work in front-end website design and development, as I really appreciate beautiful, intuitive and accessible websites. 
            I would love to be able to support small businesses in my work. A position of this kind would allow me to utilise my creativity, which I have not been able to do regularly in previous jobs.</p>
          <h3 class="content-sub-title">Strengths and limitations</h3>
          <p class="content-text">I am very conscientious when it comes to my learning - I will persevere until I am proud of my work and feel like I have a solid grasp of concepts. I am great at communicating and I am good at supporting others and sharing my knowledge when I can. <br><br>
            I do have a tendency to fixate on small points, which could cause me to fall behind if I do not manage my time well. While I can be confident when working in an area I feel comfortable and knowledgeable in, I can get quite anxious and doubt my abilities when I do not understand new concepts as quickly as I think I should. 
          </p>
          <h3 class="content-sub-title">Skills for development</h3>
          <p class="content-text">I would love to work on my confidence and presentation skills while studying at Dev Academy. I am not a great at presenting on the spot. Often, I only feel truly comfortable presenting my ideas when I have had a lot of time to prepare and feel like I understand what I am presenting about fully.
          </p>
          <h3 class="content-sub-title">Workload management</h3>
          <p class="content-text">I am committed to studying full-time during my time on the Dev Academy programme. <br><br> 
            I will follow the time-box suggestions for each activity and note down areas where I don't fully grasp the concept but need to move on to get the rest of the work done. This will help me prioritise what to re-visit when I have finished the rest of the material for that week.<br><br>
            I will treat my peers, Facilitators and any industry or community representatives with kindness and respect at all times to play my part in making the programme an uplifting and supportive environment to be in. <br><br>
            When things are building up, I will examine how I have spent my time that week and identify where I might have spent too much time or not enough time. I will evaluate what distractions were around me at the time, to see if there are any that I can eliminate or minimise. 
          </p>
          <h3 class="content-sub-title">Seeking help</h3>
          <p class="content-text">I will seek support from my family and friends when I start to feel anxious and doubt myself, as quite often a pep talk from them goes a long way! <br><br>
            I will help myself by making sure I have taken breaks, moved around, gotten some sunshine and eaten well. I will use positive self-talk to remind myself that I can do this, and it is ok to not understand everything straight away. <br><br>
            I will seek guidance from my peers first when I have questions, so that we can all help one another. If I have not resolved my issue, I will seek guidance from my Facilitators. I will also note down non-urgent questions to raise in my Homegroup. 
          </p>
          <h3 class="content-sub-title">The Facilitation team</h3>
          <p class="content-text">I expect the Facilitation team to provide regular opportunities to check in, constructive feedback on work submitted and guidance to material that will help on the learning journey. 
          </p>
          <h3 class="content-sub-title">Block-out times</h3>
          <p class="content-text">During Foundations, I would like to keep my study week confined to Monday - Friday 8.30am - 5.00pm as much as possible, to leave time for my family and friends in the evenings and weekends. <br><br>
            I am committed to a weekend away from the morning of Friday 22 July, so I need to commit to having my Sprint 5 work completed by the evening of Thursday 21 July.
