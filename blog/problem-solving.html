        <h3 class="content-sub-title">A simple problem</h3>

        <p class="content-text">
          I was working on a problem which required me to create a function (essentially the instructions telling the code what to do) which, when a collection of numbers were put into the function, would return the average of those numbers.<br>
          For somebody experienced, this would be an extremely simple task. In fact, once I used my best friend Google, there were many examples of how to do this. So I scanned over the instructions one more time and then wrote my function based on what I had found. 
          <br><br>
          It. Would. Not. Pass. The. Test. 
          <br><br>
          I was so sure that I had it right. I hopped on Discord and could see that someone was having a similar problem, and their code looked almost exactly the same as mine but someone had told them to double check their syntax. I still couldn't see what to change in mine so I asked for an extra hint. 
          <br><br>
          Then in swooped a facilitator with one succinct statement, "I think you want your total to start at zero." 
          <br><br>
          The instructions had said "create a variable (something that you can store data values in) called 'total', which should start at zero." I saw this instruction, but for some reason I had translated it in my mind to be "make your total an empty array", something I had being doing for some earlier problems. 
          <br><br>
          My total should have looked like: 'let total = 0', but mine was 'let total = [ ]'. 
          <br><br>
          Sure enough, as soon as I changed that one thing - bam. The test passed. 
          <br><br>
          I felt relief as soon as the test passed, especially because it meant that it wasn't some big concept I wasn't understanding. However, I also felt embarrassed that I had misunderstood such a simple instruction and a bit of annoyance with myself that that was all it was. 
          <br><br>
          I learned to slow down, reading instructions properly and look at my code line by line!

        <h3 class="content-sub-title">Elegantly solving problems</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          One of the problems this week required us to add things to and manipulate objects (a type of variable in JavaScript in which you can store multiple values). 
          <br><br>
          We had an object which stored information about a person called 'Terah'. We had gone through and added values for their spouse and children using code shown below:
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img class="blog-image" src="../images/elegant problem.JPG" alt="code depicting adding values to objects">
        </div>

        <p class = "content-text">
          The final step was to give the 'Adam' object the same children as the 'Terah' object. To me, it seemed natural to just say: <br>adam.children = terah.children
          <br><br>
          Now I know that isn't ground breaking, but I was watching a tutorial later and I realised that there were other ways to do it, but the one I picked first was an 'elegant' option. 
          <br><br>
          On this occasion, my problem solving technique was to just trust my inclinations and try something! It hasn't worked out much on this course so far but it did that time, which made me feel proud. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="content-sub-title">Problem solving techniques</h3>

        <p class="content-text">
          <b>Pseudocode:</b> I'm not great at this so far, but I see the merits of it so I need to work on it. I found myself writing more comments <i>afterwards</i>, to process what did or did not work. 
          <br><br>
          <b>Just trying something:</b> I haven't done this a whole lot because often I hit a block in my brain that says "you don't know the syntax for that." However, there was one challenge this week though where I didn't know where to start but went to Google first, rather than looking at the hints in the problem. That led me down a path of trying the string.replace method - I got most of the way with this method despite it being different to the one in the hints. Even though I couldn't fully make it work, I am glad I tried it because it really helped me understand how to use it!
          <br><br>
          <b>Rubber ducky method:</b> This method involves stepping away from the problem and talking it through to someone or something (like a rubber duck) who has not been involved in the problem. Often, part way through describing the problem, the solution may pop into your brain. To be honest, I haven't tried this yet - but I have talked to myself out loud! 
          <br><br>
          <b>Reading error messages:</b> I have found the error messages really helpful for showing me where exactly in the code there is a problem. They also provide good keywords for Googling. 
          <br><br>
          <b>Console.logging:</b> This has been SO HELPFUL. I have been using it more and more to see if I am on the right track. 
          <br><br>
          <b>Googling:</b> I talk to Google more than anyone else these days. I have professional research experience so it is a very natural inclination to look for a whole range of sources and sift through them to find the most helpful one. I am very practised at skim reading for keywords! Some of the sources are not at all helpful for beginners but for some of them you can strip away the extra stuff to pluck a gem out of them. 
          <br><br>
          <b>Asking peers for help:</b> I am getting better at this as I go through the course because I feel like I can articulate my questions a bit better at this stage and have gotten over taking the risk of feeling embarrassed. I asked my colleagues for help all the time in my last job, so I am just trying to imagine Discord as if we are all in the same office together. 
          <br><br>
          <b>Asking coaches for help:</b> So far, I seem to have been able to piggy-back off other people asking for help and jumping on the call with them. I feel comfortable with the concept of asking for a call, but something in my brain still sees it as a last resort. I'm not sure if this is a good or a bad thing, but I think it is to do with stubbornness as I am often convinced I should be able to work it out with other methods. 
          <br><br>
          <b>Reflection:</b> I have used this a lot this week. I was very stuck on SuperFizzBuzz for a while and said I would "just leave it there for the day and take a break". Except I didn't. I was trying to watch TV but kept mulling it over in my brain and obsessively Googling. Then I would be convinced I had had a lightbulb moment, so I would come back to my computer and try again. I felt awful and then had the worst night's sleep because I wouldn't stop thinking about it. On another day, I finished the day stuck on a problem again but my attitude was very different for some reason. I truly made myself stop and not think about it or look at it until the next day. I came back to it the next day refreshed and alert and I think it made all the difference. The point to this ramble is that I have reflected on these two difference scenarios and tucked that away in my brain to remember how much better I perform when I have a proper break!
